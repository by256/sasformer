This repository contains the source code for the Sasformer model from Multi-task Scattering-Model Classification and Parameter Regression of Nanostructures from Small-Angle Scattering Data.

## SAS-55M-20k Dataset

Details on how to download the SAS-55M-20k dataset will be found here following publication of the manuscript of this work.

## Installation

After you have downloaded the SAS-55M-20k dataset, clone the repository and navigate to the `sasformer` parent directory.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:by256/sasformer.git
cd <path>/<to>/sasformer
```

Using [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html), create and activate the virtual environment and install the package.

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate sasformer
python -m pip install -e .
```

## Training

To train SASformer using the hyperparameters specified in the paper, update `data_dir` in `scripts/train_sasformer.sh` with the path of the SAS-55M-20k dataset and run the following script:

```bash
bash scripts/train_sasformer.sh
```

Note: we used a batch size of 1843 for training, but it is likely that you will have to adjust the `batch_size` parameter in this script to suit your hardware. Additionally, if you do not possess a graphics processing unit, change the `accelerator` parameter to `cpu`.

## Inference

To see an example of inference on I(q) generated using `sasmodels`, see the `sasformer/example.ipynb` notebook.

You can open this file by installing Jupyter Notebook, running it in the `sasformer/sasformer` directory and clicking on the `example.ipynb` file in the jupyter notebook file browser:

```bash
python -m pip install notebook
cd sasformer
jupyter notebook
# click on `example.py`.
```

## Results

To generate the test-set results presented in the paper, update `data_dir` in `scripts/results.sh` with the path of the SAS-55M-20k dataset and run the following script:

```bash
bash scripts/results.sh
```

You may have to adjust the `batch_size` and `accelerator` script parameters as mentioned in the [Training](#training) section.
